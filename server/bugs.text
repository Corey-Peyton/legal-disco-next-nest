- tree data getting hide when we switch from one data source to another data source in project tree in in page
- currently after login it is not redirecting to original page
- clicking on datasource is not opening upload page directly. we have to reload page
- browser title is showing as title instead of ecdisco
- search filter add delete buttons are not proper in height
- when wifi is connected, it is not able to detect vmware redis
- during project start, it time outs a lot.
- when 0 kb file is uploaded. Extract project throws error
- SERIOUS ISSUE. Currently project id is common for base controller. so multiple methods can messup project id due to async behaviour. Need fix.
